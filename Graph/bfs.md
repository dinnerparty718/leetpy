# BFS

## best for find shortest path (unweighted)

todo how to reconstruct the shortest path

## if use DFS, need to find all possible path, and choose the shortest one


Time Complexity: O(V + E) Here, V represents the number of vertices, and E represents the number of edges. 
Space Complexity: O(V) Generally, we will check if a vertex has been visited before adding it to the


-using queue
-when queue is empty, program done
-keep a visited list
