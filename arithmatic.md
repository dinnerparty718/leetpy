While you might be tempted to use multiplication and division for a few "simple" tasks, this is unnecessary. Here are some alternatives:
Instead of a = a * -1 for making numbers negative, use a = -a.
Instead of using a / 2 for dividing by 2, use the right shift operator; a >> 1.
Instead of using a * 2 for doubling, use a = a + a, a += a, or even the left shift operator; a << 1.
