# Native and a Hybrid App

when to use native

    - You have heavy graphic and hardware requirements, like when developing a mobile game, a video editor or a game streaming app. In this scenario, even a tad bit of lag is unacceptable. We cannot compromise on performance.
    - Say you intend to write an app with heavy UI animations, like, a fancy social app having a lot of animations, a finance app containing a lot of real-time charts and graphs and so on. In this scenario, again, it’s unacceptable to have any sort of lag in the application. The application needs to be as responsive and reliable as possible.
    - The app is pretty complex and relies on hardware access, like camera, sensors, GPS, etc., to function. In this scenario, we typically have to write a lot of platform-specific code. A GPS, sensor-based health and a step-tracking app is good example of this.
    - The look and feel of the app and the user experience are expected to be just like the native OS and when the UI needs to be, not just functional but flawless.
    - You have other businesses in the same niche competing with you with native apps. It would be a blunder to offer our service via a hybrid app. Users today aren’t installing as many apps as they used to. Don’t expect them to show mercy on you when you don’t have a better product than your competition.
    - The app needs to support new mobile OS features as soon as they are released.
    - You are a business that can afford dedicated teams for Android and iOS. You should go ahead with native apps. Don’t even think about the hybrid app approach.
