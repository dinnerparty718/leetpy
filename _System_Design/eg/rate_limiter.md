against abusive behaviors targeting the application layer like

benefits
- Misbehaving clients/scripts
- Security
- To prevent abusive behavior and bad design practices

- Revenue
- To eliminate spikiness in traffic


Funtional
1. 15 per second
2. total count across a combination of server

Non-Function
1. Highly
2. should not introduce latencies


How
Rate Limiting
Throttling - HTTP status â€œ429 - Too many requests".
    Hard Throttling
    Soft Throttling
    Elastic or Dynamic Throttling

Fixed Window Algorithm
Rolling Window Algorithm
Sliding Window with Counters (best)

    use redis hash
    Write-back cache
